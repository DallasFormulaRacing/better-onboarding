Hey, welcome to the "renovated" onboarding for the [Dallas Formula Racing](https://dallasformularacing.com/) - Software subteam! Here you will be able to find a table of contents for all of the various topics you should at least cover during your onboarding process, along with any "basic" resources you might need to get acquainted with the systems & technologies we use within our team.

!!! info "WIP" 
    This wiki is currently a **work in progress** project that does not reflect all of the resources or projects within DFR at this moment in time, and as such should not be treated as the be all and end all of information regarding our internal systems.

# Introduction

Unfortunately, as goes for many schools, UTD does not (in most cases) provide the needed learning material for many of the technologies that are utilized within [DFR](https://dallasformularacing.com/) ([Dallas Formula Racing](https://dallasformularacing.com/)). The same goes for many of the technologies that you will likely end up using in your professional life. Thus the goal of this "onboarding" is to give you "Everything you need to knoooow, to get up to speeeeed, on DFR Software!" (yea I'm a [Donut](https://donut.media/) fan, so what), and hopefully along the way you'll learn some things that will actually be applicable to your professional life in the future.
