# About

In an effort to better bring new members of the DFR Software team onboard, it was requested by [Arjun Nayak](https://github.com/Squidtoon99) that a slew of new resources be made or compiled into a single place. As such, here we are, the one stop shop of anything and everything you might need to know about the operations of DFR Software. From how to get started within our team, to the projects we are currently working on, and beyond, the goal of this wiki is to provide answers to any potential question you might have about DFR Software.
