# Introduction

The [Python](https://www.python.org/) language is the **CORE** of all the software within [DFR](https://dallasformularacing.com/). It is critical that you are at the very least willing to learn the language, as otherwise your participation within the [DFR](https://dallasformularacing.com/) Software team will be **highly limited**.

From a very basic point of view, [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high level interpreted language, which essentially means that it uses conventional human readable words for its basic syntax structure, an example of which can be found below, and isn't a compiled language.

``` Python
import random # How you bring in external packages (classes), in this case the "random" package.

num = random.random() # assigning a variable named "num" to the returned value of the "random" function from within the "random" package.

print(num) # prints the value of the "num" variable to the console.
```

Because [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high level language, this means that it is, for most people, relatively easy to learn, and holds little nuance when compared to lower level languages like [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=msvc-170), or [Java](https://www.java.com/en/). Which also means that the learning experience is much more enjoyable, due to its simplicity, than other languages. (unless of course you're a masochist)

## Already know another language?

If you are already familiar with another language and want to translate your skills over to Python, it should be relatively easy! Go ahead and check out [Learn X in Y minutes' python write-up](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) for the most straight forward examples of proper Python syntax.

You may also find any of the resources from the below section useful when learning Python for the first time.

## Where do I begin?

Brand new to Python or coding in general? No worries, below are some of the best write up's and publicly available resources for dipping your toes into the Python language.
